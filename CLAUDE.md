# Claude Code Instructions

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Notes
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT run any shell commands automatically unless explicitly requested by the user
- Only use execute_shell_command when the user specifically asks to run something
- Focus on code implementation and file creation/editing instead of running commands
